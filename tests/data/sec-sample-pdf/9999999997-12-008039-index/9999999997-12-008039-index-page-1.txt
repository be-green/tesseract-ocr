GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
Federal:
Who Must File: All issuers making an offering of securities in reliance on an exemption under Regulation D or Section 4(6), 17 CFR 230.501 et seq. or 15 U.S.C.
774(6).
When To File: A notice must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities in the offering. A notice is deemed filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) on the earlier of the date it is received by the SEC at the address given below or, if received at that address after the date on which it is
due, on the date it was mailed by United States registered or certified mail to that address.
Where to File: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.
Copies Required: Two (2) copies of this notice must be filed with the SEC, one of which must be manually signed. Any copies not manually signed must be
photocopies of the manually signed copy or bear typed or printed signatures.                                                                                         ;
Information Required: A new filing must contain all information requested. Amendments need only report the name of the issuer and offering, any changes thereto,
the information requested in Part C, and any material changes from the information previously supplied in Parts A and B. Part E and the Appendix need not be filed
with the SEC.
Filing Fee: There is no federal filing fee.
State:
This notice shall be used to indicate reliance on the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption (ULOE) for sales of securities in those states that have adopted ULOE and
that have adopted this form. Issuers relying on ULOE must file a separate notice with the Securities Administrator in each state where sales are to be, or have been
made. If a state requires the payment of a fee as a precondition to the claim for the exemption, a fec in the proper amount shall accompany this form. This notice
shall be filed in the appropriate states in accordance with state law. The Appendix to the notice constitutes a part of this notice and must be completed.
ATTENTION
Failure to file notice in the appropriate states will not result in a loss of the federal exemption. Conversely, failure to file the
appropriate federal notice will not result in a loss of an available state exemption unless such exemption is predicated on the
filing of a federal notice.
Potential persons who are to respond to the collections of information contained in this form are not required to respond
unless the form displays a currently valid OMB control number.
